#Installation

SockBot Markov, like SockBot 2.0, is written entirely in JavaScript using ES6 syntax.
As such, it has the same environment compatibility and testing procedures; see the [SockBot documentation](https://sockbot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/) for details.

##Environment setup

Sockbot Markov requires the same environment as SockBot 2.0; see the [SockBot documentation](https://sockbot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/) for details.

##Installation

The preferred method of installation is via NPM; simply run this command within the SockBot installation folder:
```
npm install sockbot-markov
```

Other methods of installation are possible e.g. cloning the git repository, but only installation via NPM is supported.

##Post Install Setup

If you installed via NPM skip this step as NPM has already installed all necessary dependencies.
Otherwise you will need to run the following command in the folder where you installed SockBot Markov:
```
npm install
```
